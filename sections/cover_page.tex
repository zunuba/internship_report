    Through this internship, I gained practical experience in international project financial management, developed professional skills in accounting and financial reporting, and learned about the complexities of cross-cultural business operations. The experience has significantly enhanced my understanding of real-world business practices and has provided valuable insights into the infrastructure development sector.
