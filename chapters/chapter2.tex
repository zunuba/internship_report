\section{Financial Reporting Process Flow}

\subsection{Monthly Reporting Cycle}
The financial reporting process at Asia Trade \& Technology follows a monthly cycle. Field accountants collect financial data from project sites like Brahmanbaria. This data includes expenses for materials, labor, equipment, and other project costs.

The process has several stages: data collection, review, verification, approval, and payment processing. Each stage has specific responsibilities and timelines to maintain financial control.

Figure \ref{fig:financial_flowchart} shows the complete monthly financial reporting process flow from data collection to final payment processing.

\subsection{Key Process Stages}
The financial reporting process has five main stages:

1. **Data Collection**: Field accountants gather receipts, invoices, and other documents during the first week of each month.

2. **Initial Review**: The Dhaka office accounting team checks documents for completeness and basic accuracy.

3. **Detailed Verification**: Each expense is carefully examined for accuracy, budget compliance, and proper authorization.

4. **Error Correction**: If issues are found, reports are returned to field accountants for correction and resubmission.

5. **Final Approval**: After verification, the Dhaka manager approves the report and sends it to Beijing headquarters for payment processing.

\section{Document Management System}

\subsection{Document Organization}
The company organizes financial documents into categories: receipts, invoices, timesheets, purchase orders, and project reports. Documents are stored by project, date, and expense type for easy access.

Figure \ref{fig:document_management} shows the document management system flow from input through classification, verification, storage, and archiving.

\subsection{Document Processing}
Receipts and invoices are the most important documents. Each document is checked for completeness, proper authorization, and accuracy. The system has multiple checkpoints to prevent errors and fraud.

The company uses both digital and physical storage systems. Digital storage includes backup procedures and access controls. Physical storage uses secure filing cabinets and storage rooms. Regular audits ensure both systems work properly.

The archiving process involves transferring documents from active storage to long-term storage when they are no longer needed for current operations. Archived documents are stored in a secure location and are accessible when needed for audits, legal proceedings, or historical reference. The archiving system includes proper indexing and cataloging to ensure that archived documents can be easily located when required.

The document retention and archiving system is designed to comply with international standards and local regulatory requirements. This system helps to ensure that the company maintains proper records while managing storage costs and maintaining efficient access to current documents.

\subsection{Access Control and Security}
Access to financial documents is controlled through a system of permissions and security measures that ensure only authorized personnel can view or modify documents. Access levels are determined based on job responsibilities and the need to know specific information. Regular reviews of access permissions are conducted to ensure that access rights remain appropriate and up to date.

Security measures include password protection for digital systems, physical security for storage areas, and audit trails that track who has accessed specific documents and when. These security measures help to protect sensitive financial information and ensure that documents are not compromised or accessed by unauthorized personnel. Regular security audits are conducted to identify and address any potential vulnerabilities in the system.

The access control and security system is designed to balance the need for accessibility with the requirement for security. This system ensures that authorized personnel can access the documents they need to perform their duties while protecting sensitive information from unauthorized access.

\section{Approval Hierarchy}

\subsection{Three-Level Approval System}
The company uses a three-level approval system for financial decisions:

1. **Field Level**: Field accountants in Brahmanbaria review and approve local expenses
2. **Office Level**: Dhaka office managers provide oversight and validate field decisions  
3. **Headquarters Level**: Beijing headquarters gives final approval and strategic oversight

\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:approval_hierarchy} shows the three main levels of authority and their responsibilities.

\subsection{Key Responsibilities}
- **Field Accountant**: Reviews expenses, checks documentation, prepares monthly reports
- **Office Manager**: Reviews calculations, verifies budget limits, ensures policy compliance
- **Headquarters**: Final budget review, corporate standards, regulatory compliance

The system ensures proper oversight while maintaining efficient operations.

\section{Budget Control}

\subsection{Budget Management}
The company plans project budgets based on requirements, technical specs, and market conditions. Budgets are allocated across different project activities and categories. The process is regularly reviewed and updated as project needs change.

Figure \ref{fig:budget_control} shows the budget control process from planning through monitoring and evaluation.

\subsection{Expense Monitoring}
The company monitors expenses in real-time against budgeted amounts. They track expense trends and identify potential budget overruns. Regular reviews of financial reports help identify cost issues early.

\subsection{Variance Analysis}
The company regularly analyzes differences between budgeted and actual expenses. This helps identify causes of variances and determine if corrective action is needed. Reports are prepared and distributed to stakeholders for decision-making.

\subsection{Cost Control}
The company implements cost control procedures throughout projects. They regularly review expenses, monitor procurement, and analyze cost trends. This helps prevent unnecessary expenses and ensures all spending is properly justified.

\subsection{Budget Adjustments}
The company allows budget changes when project requirements or market conditions change. All adjustments must be properly documented and authorized. Regular reviews help identify where adjustments may be needed.
