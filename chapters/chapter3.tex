\section{Key Observations and Insights}

\subsection{Internship Experience Overview}
My eight-week internship at Asia Trade \& Technology gave me valuable insights into how financial and accounting principles work in real business. I learned about document processing, financial reporting, budget control, and process improvement. Working on the River Protection project showed me the challenges of managing financial operations for large infrastructure projects.

The company had a supportive learning environment where experienced professionals shared their knowledge. This helped me develop skills quickly and apply what I learned in class to real situations.
